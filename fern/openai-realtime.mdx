OpenAI's Realtime API enables developers to create low-latency, voice-driven interactions within applications by leveraging a speech-to-speech model. This API processes audio input and output in real-time, supporting seamless, natural conversations without intermediate text conversion.

To start using it with your Vapi assistants, select `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01` as your model. 
- Please note that only OpenAI voices may be selected while using this model. The voice selection will not act as a TTS (text-to-speech) model, but rather as the voice used within the speech-to-speech model.

<Note>
  The Realtime API is currently in beta, and not recommended for production use by OpenAI. We're excited to have you try this new feature and welcome your [feedback](https://discord.com/invite/pUFNcf2WmH) as we continue to refine and improve the experience.
