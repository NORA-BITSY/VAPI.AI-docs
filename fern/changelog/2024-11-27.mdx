1. **New Knowledge Base API Endpoints**: You can now create a knowledge base with [`POST /knowledge-base`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_create), list knowledge bases with [`GET /knowledge-base`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_findAll) or [`GET /knowledge-base/{id}`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_findOne) for a specific knowledge base, update a knowledge base with [`PATCH /knowledge-base/{id}`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_update), or delete a knowledge base with [`DELETE /knowledge-base/{id}`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Knowledge%20Base/KnowledgeBaseController_remove).

2. **Configure Custom Knowledge Bases for your Assistant**: Configure a custom knowledge base for your assistant in three steps by first uploading a file [through the dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/files) or  [the API](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Files/FileController_create), then [create a knowledge base](https://docs.vapi.ai/knowledgebase#step-2-create-a-knowledge-base), and lastly [updating your assistant](https://docs.vapi.ai/knowledgebase#step-3-create-an-assistant) with the knowledge base id. You can also assign a knowledge base to models like `GroqModel`, `VapiModel`, `GoogleModel`, and others using the new `knowledgeBaseId` property.


3. **Integration with Trieve Knowledge Base**: Vapi now supports [Trieve](https://trieve.ai/) as our first knowledge base provider. Refer to [our docs](https://docs.vapi.ai/knowledgebase#step-2-create-a-knowledge-base) for an example of how to use Trieve.


4. **Inflection AI Credential Management**: You can now manage Inflection AI credentials through the [updated providers credentials](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys) page. `Call.endedReason` also now enumerates new values like `'pipeline-error-inflection-ai-llm-failed'` to indicate specific Inflection AI errors.
