# October 30 to November 3, 2024

1. **Access Transport Details and Costs**: You can now use `call.transport` to access details about the provider used for a call (`twilio`, `vonage`, `vapi`, or `daily`), and whether the assistant's video is enabled for web calls (`assistantVideoEnabled`). Additionally, transport costs in `call.costs[type=transport]` now include a `provider` field, allowing you to see which provider contributed to the transport cost.

2. **Manage Tavus Credentials**: You can now create and update Tavus credentials in the [updated Provider Credentials page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys).
