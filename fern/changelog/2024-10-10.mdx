1. **Purchase Reserved Concurrency and Scale Infinitely**: You can now reserve more concurrent calls with Vapi and scale infinitely by switching to our new top up payment system on the [billing page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/billing). To migrate, click "Switch to Credit Based Billing" and make a payment. Advantages include:

  - **Support More Users Without Limits**: You don't need to worry about getting throttled or staying under usage limits on the conversations you can have with Vapi.
  - **Predictable Budgets**: You know exactly how much you will spend on Vapi each month, and you can top up at any time as your needs grow.
  - **Select Add-Ons You Need**: The credit based billing page allows you to select HIPAA compliance, dedicated Slack support, and the maximum number of concurrent calls you expect.

<Warning>This will require human input to login and migrate your account. You will not be able to revert back to the old billing system.</Warning>
