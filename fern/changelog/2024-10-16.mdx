# October 13 to October 16, 2024

1. **Apply Coupons to Subscriptions**: You can now apply coupons by specifying a `couponId` to add to a subscription.

2. **Detect Custom Transcriber Failures in Call End Reasons**: You can now handle cases where a custom transcriber fails during a call with `'pipeline-error-custom-transcriber-failed'`, a new `endedReason` option. This is now accessible in `Call`, `ServerMessageStatusUpdate`, and `ServerMessageEndOfCallReport`.

3. **Corrected Typo in Example Custom Voice Request**: We fixed a typo in `CustomVoice.server`, where the example request now shows how to use the `"message"` parameter instead of the misspelled `"messsage"`.
