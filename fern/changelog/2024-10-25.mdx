1. **Specify API Traffic Channel for Organizations**: You can now configure which `channel` (cluster) your API traffic will be routed to. Select between *daily* or *weekly* in your [organization settings page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/settings)

2. **Customize Tavus Voice Properties**: You can now use Tavus as a voice provider under `assistant.voice`. Configure additional properties like language, recording options, and transcriptions via `assistant.voice.properties`.

3. **Multilingual Support in Tool Messages**: You can now use the `contents` property in `ToolMessageStart`, `ToolMessageFailed`, `ToolMessageDelayed`, and `ToolMessageComplete` to provide message variants for different languages. If you don't provide content for a language, the first item will be automatically translated to the active language during the conversation.

4. **Automatic Translation of Message Contents**: For `CustomMessage`, `BlockStartMessage`, and `BlockCompleteMessage`, if specific content isn't provided for a language in `contents`, Vapi automatically translates the first item to the active language by default.

5. **Removed Backchanneling Configuration**: The `backchannelingEnabled` property has been removed from when creating or updating `Assistant` or `AssistantOverrides`. Backchanneling is no longer configurable in assistant settings.
