# November 6 to November 11, 2024

1. **Subscription Updates**: You can now check the number of minutes used in a subscription with `Subscription.minutesUsed` (Enterprise only).

2. **Updates to Concurrency Limits in your Subscription**: `Subscription.concurrencyLimit` now shows both the included and purchased limits, which better represents the total concurrency limit. Refer to the [Subscription schema](https://api.vapi.ai/api/) for more details.
  - Use `Subscription.concurrencyLimitIncluded` to get the default concurrency limit provided with the subscription.
  - Use `Subscription.concurrencyLimitPurchased` to get any additional purchased concurrency limit.
