1. **Invite Multiple Users via Email**: You can now invite up to 100 users at once by providing a list of email addresses inside your [org users page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/users). Click `'+'` after entering an email address, select the role as *Editor* or *Admin*, and click `'Invite'`.

2. **Simplified Subscription Status Handling**: Your subscription status no longer includes the `past-due` status, so you can streamline your subscription management without handling 'past-due' scenarios.
