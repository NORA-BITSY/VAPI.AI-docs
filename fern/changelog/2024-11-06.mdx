# November 4 to November 6, 2024

1. **New Anthropic model `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` added**: You can now use `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` in your assistants. Specify `anthropic` in `Assistant.model.provider` and `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` in `Assistant.model`.

2. **Payment `cost`, Subscription `credits` and `couponUsageLeft` are now strings**: These properties are now strings to avoid floating point precision errors. Please update your applications to handle these values as strings.

3. **Advanced call logging improvements**: You can now access detailed call logs through the [updated call logs page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/calls) or [`GET /logs?type=Call`](https://api.vapi.ai/api#/Logs/LoggingController_queryLogs) endpoint. Refer to `CallLogPrivileged` or `CallLogsPaginatedResponse` schemas in the [updated API reference](https://api.vapi.ai/api) to learn more.
